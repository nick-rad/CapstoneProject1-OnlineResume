<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<ul>
  <li>Movies</li>
  <p>I enjoy watching the occasional movie but get impatient and find 
    myelf either binge watching or partial watching multiple movies on 
    a streaming service such as netflix.<br />
    I enjoyed watching the channel by Robert Murray-Smith creating various 
    projects including batteries, generators, and several motors. I especially 
    liked his approach to repurposing discarded items.

  <li>Magnets</li>
  <p>I have always been fascinated about magnets and occasionally engage in
    finding out about or conducting my own experiments using magnets.
  </p>
  <li>3D printing and Design</li>
  I enjoy a bit of 3D printing and design. I mainly make functional 
  parts - either for home use or for testing theories.
  I have made several practical models such as a working cat flap, 
  a rain guard for a fly trap, some drain covers, curtain rail 
  hangers, etc.
